## Duration between keyframes

###

- deselect all keyframes,\
  - hold `shift+alt`,
  - click '1st keyframe' / '2nd keyframe'
  - in the info panel (I know lol who uses that shit), you'll see a new entry below the first divider!
  - to see duration between two keyframes,
  - deselect all keyframes,
  - hold 'shift+alt',
  - click '1st keyframe' / '2nd keyframe'
  - in the info panel (I know lol who uses that shit), you'll see a new entry below the first divider!

### Fix wonky interpolation

- Ever copy and paste some eased keyframes just to find that there's now some strange anticipatory/etc movement in the space between?\
  - It's because After Effects prefers to smooth motion between two keyframes by default.\
  - The fix: highlight impacted keyframes, ctrl+shift+w for toggle hold keyframes.\
  - THAT'S why toggle holds come in square, left indent, right indent, left exdent, right exdent forms.\
  - The left and right indent forms indicate a continuous bezier keyframe (the hourglass shape we all know and love)!\
