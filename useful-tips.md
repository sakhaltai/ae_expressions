# A collection of tips to remember from random youtube vids over the years

### Duration between keyframes ###
to see duration between two keyframes,
1. deselect all keyframes,
2. hold 'shift+alt',
3. click '1st keyframe' / '2nd keyframe'
4. in the info panel (I know lol who uses that shit), you'll see a new entry below the first divider!

### Fix wonky interpolation ###
- Ever copy and paste some eased keyframes just to find that there's now some strange anticipatory/etc movement in the space between?
- It's because After Effects prefers to smooth motion between two keyframes by default.
- The fix: highlight impacted keyframes, ctrl+shift+w for toggle hold keyframes.
- THAT'S why toggle holds come in square, left indent, right indent, left exdent, right exdent forms.
- The left and right indent forms indicate a continuous bezier keyframe (the hourglass shape we all know and love)!
