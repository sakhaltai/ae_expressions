### Fix wonky interpolation

- Ever copy and paste some eased keyframes just to find that there's now some strange anticipatory/etc movement in the space between?\
  - It's because After Effects prefers to smooth motion between two keyframes by default.\
  - The fix: highlight impacted keyframes, ctrl+shift+w for toggle hold keyframes.\
  - THAT'S why toggle holds come in square, left indent, right indent, left exdent, right exdent forms.\
  - The left and right indent forms indicate a continuous bezier keyframe (the hourglass shape we all know and love)!\

### Transform one shape layer made of multiple unsplit groups

-when you import a shape layer made of multiple groups (using overlord)\
-wait to ESL them. First, transform how you want all groups to behave\
-then, ESL. BLAMMO! They all have the same transform applied respectively :D\\
alternatively, for already-explode shape layers, use ESL merge SLs, transform as desired, then re-explode.\
*_Thank you so much for ESL and everything else you do, [Zack Lovatt (ctrl+click since github doesn't allow target=blank)](https://aescripts.com/explode-shape-layers/)
